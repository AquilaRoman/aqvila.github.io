					<p>In 2017, I became interested in forging and metalworking.
					In the beginning, I literally started with a few tools that
					I found in my dad's garage. My forge was very primitive and 
					simple, and I gathered knowledge from books, forums and YouTube. 
					I've had a lot of ups and downs along the way, and I still have a lot to learn.</p>

			  							In order to have the best possible sword, you need two things, high-quality steel
										and even more important heat treatment.<br/>
			  							The quality of the steel is the most important and will
										depend primarily on the percentage
										of carbon it contains, high carbon steels are 
										the best, of course other metals are usually added to improve
										the quality, such as chromium, which increases 
										the elasticity of the steel and reduces the possibility of corrosion.
										But heat treatment plays a key role, because even the best steel without adequate
										heat treatment is unusable and the worst steel with adequate heat treatment will overpower it.
			  							<br/>Heat treatment works by heating the steel to a certain temperature, which is easily 
										determined by technology today, but the desired temperature can still be determined 
										the old-fashioned way by looking at the color of the heated steel
										<br/>Once the desired temperature is reached, the steel is cooled by immersion,usually in oil,
										but water is also used to determine the type of steel.By sudden cooling, the steel changes its structure at 
										the atomic level, which results in a better performance of the steel
